This module provides bindings for the `ADMesh <https://github.com/admesh/admesh>`_ library. It lets you manipulate 3D models in binary or ASCII STL format and partially repair them if necessary.

Installation
------------

First, you'll need to install the `ADMesh <https://github.com/admesh/admesh>`_ library. This release is designed for ADMesh 0.98.x. Follow the instructions there. Then you can install this as usual with **one** of the following:

.. code:: sh

    ./setup.py install
    python3 setup.py install # for Python 3
    pip install admesh # install directly from PyPI

In case your ADMesh library is located in non-standard location, you'll have to tell the compiler and linker where to look:

.. code:: sh

    LDFLAGS='-L/path/to/library' CFLAGS='-I/path/to/header' ./setup.py install

Usage
-----

Use the ``Stl`` class provided.

.. code:: python

    import admesh
    
    # load an STL file
    stl = admesh.Stl('file.stl')
    
    # observe the available methods
    help(stl)
    
    # read the stats
    stl.stats
    
    # see how many facets are there
    len(stl)
    
    # walk the facets
    for facet in stl:
        # get the normal
        facet['normal']
        # walk the vertices
        for vertex in facet['vertex']:
            # read the coordinates
            vertex['x']
            vertex['y']
            vertex['z']

    # add another set of facets
    # every facet is a tuple (vertices, normal) or a dict
    stl.add_facets([
        (((0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)), (1, 0, 0)),
        {'vertex': [{'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'z': 0},
                    {'x': 1, 'y': 0, 'z': 0},
                    {'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'z': 1}],
         'normal': {'x': 0, 'y': 1, 'z': 0}},
    ])

Note that all C ADMesh functions start with ``stl_`` prefix and the Python methods of this module do not. Also note that not all C ADMesh functions are provided, because some would require more complicated approach and are not considered worthy. In case you are missing some functions, create `new issue <https://github.com/admesh/python-admesh/issues/new>`_.
